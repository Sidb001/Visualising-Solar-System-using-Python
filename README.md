# Visualising-Solar-System-using-Python
Visualising Solar System with basic Maths and Python Functions.
In This I have used Plotly to plot the 3D view of the Solar System.
This Requires a knowledge of Spherical Coordinate system.
 - Spherical cooridates are used to position objects in 3D Space.
 - Three parameters of Spherical Coordinates are (r,theta,phi)
 - r = Radial Distance, It is the distance from the origin.
 - theta = Polar Angle, It is the angle made by the X-axis
 - phi = Azimuthal Angle, It is the angle made by the Y-axis.  

Here I have defined 3 functions,
 - Spheres = This function creates a sphere.
 - Orbit = This function creates an orbit in which spheres will be placed.
 - Annotations = This will name or annotate each spehere.
